        I’ve applied these technologies in both academic and professional
        settings, working on real-world projects that emphasize clean code,
        usability, and maintainability. While I continue to deepen my experience
        across these stacks, I’m always open to learning new tools and
        technologies that support better and more reliable solutions.
